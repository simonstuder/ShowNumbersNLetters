# ShowNumbersNLetters
Musescore Plugin to display numbers or letters for beginners and mainly brass instruments below the notes. 

I created this plugin to distribute music sheets in form of letters or numbers for my beginner band members with brass instruments. Trumpet, Trombone, Euphonium and Sousaphone are implemented. (Contact me or open an issue if you want others that do not work yet, you can also modify mapping files by yourself)

## Usage
This is a dock plugin.
There are settings at the top to hide repeating values or change the pitch to fingering mapping file.
At the bottom you can use the Update button to use the settings for all staffs if nothing is selected or only to the selected staffs.
The Remove button will remove the fingerings from all staffs.

## Installation
[Download](https://github.com/simonstuder/ShowNumbersNLetters/archive/main.zip) the zip file and install according to the default MuseScore [Plugin Installation](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation) method

## Translations
The languages this is available in are English and German. For others I would accept help with translation if wanted.
